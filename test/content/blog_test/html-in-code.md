Testing to make sure that HTML inside code tags work, because there was a time that they didn't: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Title</title>
        <!-- You can add css here. --->
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script src="index.js" inline="inline"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
