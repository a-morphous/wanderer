# v1.0.2

- Adds `sanitize-html` so that content can have HTML but be safe from XSS. Note that this is a dependency with dependencies of its own; security is not something I should roll by myself.
- Relies upon wanderer 1.1.4's new build order to use the generated HTML of a page as the page's content.
